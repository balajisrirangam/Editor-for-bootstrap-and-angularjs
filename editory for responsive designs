This is Balaji Srirangam. Having worked on front end technologies for many years, i was married to dreamweaver until my married software showed signs of aging. It just could not handle responsive designs, angularjs.

Especially CS5.5 is a joke to begin with. Ok so what about cs6. Well!!! the joke continues in cs6. I was tired of using their ready to use responsive template which just would not work. Dreamweaver takes a lot of time to process once you "ALT TAB" between browser previews and dreamweaver code view. Even jumping between multiple files opened in dreamweaver took a lot of time because of all the responsive code and jquery.

Sometimes typing code itself became a pain. Dreamweaver just could not handle it. The reason being it had to process the CSS properties etc every time we "ALT TAB" or switch files. Finally i had to divorce dreamweaver and switch to NOTEPAD++. Even though NOTEPAD++ is not a WYSIWYG editor it does the job perfectly. After all when you are working with responsive websites dreamweaver does a pathetic job of displaying content in design view. So if i don't get to see the design properly in design view i don't see the point of using dreamweaver anymore. I am now happy with notepad++. It also handles scripts or code more efficiently than dreamweaver.

For example i am able edit nested tags more easily in NOTEPAD++ than in dreamweaver. You should try this free editor to believe it. It handles almost all the scripts like php, angularjs etc.
